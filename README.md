Credit Card Analysis 

The idea of the project is to analyze and understand different credit card offerings and find the best one according to the user's lifestyle. 

1. Choose a website that offers credit cards (e.g. bmo.com). 

2. Specify the details of your search (cashback, no annual fee, etc.) 

3. Find the best offerings in the selected criteria.
